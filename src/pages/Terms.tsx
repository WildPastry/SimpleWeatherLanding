              Policy, which is incorporated into these Terms and Conditions.
              Please be advised the App is hosted in the United States. If you

              of the world with laws or other requirements governing personal
              data collection, use, or disclosure that differ from applicable

              App, you are transferring your data to the United States, and you
              expressly consent to have your data transferred to and processed
              in the United States.

            <h5>MISCELLANEOUS</h5>

              These Terms and Conditions and any policies or operating rules
              posted by us on the App constitute the entire agreement and
              understanding between you and us. Our failure to exercise or
              enforce any right or provision of these Terms and Conditions shall
              not operate as a waiver of such right or provision. These Terms
              and Conditions operate to the fullest extent permissible by law.
              We may assign any or all of our rights and obligations to others
              at any time. We shall not be responsible or liable for any loss,
              damage, delay, or failure to act caused by any cause beyond our
              reasonable control. If any provision or part of a provision of
              these Terms and Conditions is determined to be unlawful, void, or
              unenforceable, that provision or part of the provision is deemed
              severable from these Terms and Conditions and does not affect the
              validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. There is
              no joint venture, partnership, employment or agency relationship
              created between you and us as a result of these Terms and
              Conditions or use of the App. You agree that these Terms and
              Conditions will not be construed against us by virtue of having
              drafted them. You hereby waive any and all defences you may have
              based on the electronic form of these Terms and Conditions and the
              lack of signing by the parties hereto to execute these Terms and
              Conditions.
