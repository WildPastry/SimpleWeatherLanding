              We collect this information in order to:
              <br />
              <br />
              Grant you access to all of the features of the App by signing you
              up to our database. In order to do this we need a username and an
              email address. Providing this information is entirely optional. If
              you choose not to enter a username and email address, we'll be
              unable to save your username into our database and therefore can't
              provide you the full features of the App.

            <p className='spotGreyMed'>
              We keep your information safe by storing it in encrpyted files and
              never accessing it unless requested by an authenticated user. If

              securely destroy it by erasing it from the database. Please note
              we do not have access to user passwords, if you forget your
              password it can be securely reset using the App.
